# shapes-generator
A small program created in C# used to demonstrate the functionality of abstract classes and hierarchies. 

The main program is divided into 2 files. The view file and the module file, to have a more modularized program.

The program promts the user to first select a shape that they wish to create. 
The program will then ask the user to introduce the dimensions of the shape, depending on what they wish to create.

Once this shape is created, it will be added to an Array List that will store it until the user has created all the shapes,
and is then displayed when the exit option is selected.

The clases are based off of a hierarchy from the main Abstract Class called Shape.cs 
Depending on what the shape that is going to be created, it will implement different methods to ask for the data required.
